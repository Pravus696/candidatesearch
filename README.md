# Candidate Search

## Description

My motivation for this project was to provide an easy system for many companies to find and save potential candidates on GitHub.
I built this project to make an easy to use, and organized space to save GitHub repositories of potential candidates for a company.
This provides a simple spot to record candidates, and save them for later viewing.
Going through this project, I learned how to safely use API on the frontend while keeping the key secure from others.
